## What should I do in the summer before first year?
* Relax.
* Enjoy your summer.
* If you happen to enjoy programming, then program. If you happen to enjoy something else, do that.
* Programming for the sake of programming is a fantastic way to burn out quickly.

## 1A

### MATH115

[Good introductory playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

### MATH117

The difference between 80% and 90% on this course is usually a very conceptual problem on the midterm and final that requires you to apply previous concepts in a new environment. (examples: being told what a Laplace transform is and then being asked to calculate one, showing that there are two opposite points on the Earth with exactly the same temperature). Other than that, it's just highschool calculus plus integration.
